            <p>So this is my second attempt in several months, at learning to code by doing. What led me to this choice? I lost my first job as a Junior UI/UX Designer for a small company in London towards the end of 2022. I did suffer from imposter syndrome,
                and as it was my very first commercial role, I felt extremely out of my depth - especially being the only Designer within a eight-strong team of Developers.
            </p>
            <p>So between the end of December 2022 to about a week ago, I'd been submitting job applications for Junior positions... resulting in rejection after rejection.

            <p>So for now, I'm going to take some time to upskill to make myself more employable.</p>
            <p>Could I take a detour into Web Design? It doesn't hurt to try to learn some frontend coding.</p>
            <p>Honestly, my list of skills to achieve is LONG</p>
